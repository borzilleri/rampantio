<p><em>In the two hundred and fifty years since Rampancy first appeared 
[&hellip;], the stable Rampant AI, the 'Holy Grail' of cybertonics, has 
never come close to fruition. Since no Rampant has ever been controlled 
or turned to any useful purpose, it is the opinion of this writer and of 
the majority of the Cybertonic community that all rampant AIs are a danger 
to Cyberlife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Thrashedness.</em>
